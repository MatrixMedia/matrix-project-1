                  Google Play takes seriously the safety of children on our
                  platform and is committed to working to keep our store free of
                  child sexual abuse and exploitation. We require apps in the
                  Social and Dating categories to comply with our Child Safety
                  Standards policy.

                <h5>Overview</h5>
                <p>The Child Safety Standards policy requires apps to:</p>
                 <ul>
                 
    <li>Have published standards against child sexual abuse and exploitation (CSAE);</li>
    <li>Provide an in-app mechanism for user feedback;</li>
   <li> Address child sexual abuse material (CSAM);</li>
    <li>Comply with child safety laws;</li> 
    <li>Provide a child safety point of contact</li>.

                 </ul>
                <p>
                  Make sure to read the policy in full and ensure you understand
                  and comply. Developers who are not in compliance by the
                  deadline may be subject to enforcement actions. For more
