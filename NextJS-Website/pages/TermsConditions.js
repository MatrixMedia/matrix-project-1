                <h6><u>ENTIRE AGREEMENT</u></h6>
                <p>
                  This TOS constitutes the entire agreement between you and SangaRaahi and shall govern the use of our Services, superseding any prior version of this TOS between you and us with respect to SangaRaahi Services. There is a separate Privacy Policy that applies to your information, data and activities on SangaRaahi. You may also be subject to additional terms and conditions that may apply when you use or purchase certain other SangaRaahi Services, affiliate Services, third-party content or third-party software.
                </p>

                <h6><u>CHOICE OF LAW AND FORUM</u></h6>
                <p>
                  It is at the mutual agreement of both you and SangaRaahi with regard to the TOS that the relationship between the parties shall be governed by the laws of the state of North Carolina, USA without regard to its conflict of law provisions and that any and all claims, causes of action and/or disputes, arising out of or relating to the TOS, or the relationship between you and SangaRaahi shall be filed within the courts having jurisdiction within the County of Orange, North Carolina or the U.S. District Court located in said state. You and SangaRaahi agree to submit to the jurisdiction of the courts as previously mentioned, and agree to waive any and all objections to the exercise of jurisdiction over the parties by such courts and to venue in such courts.
                </p>

                <h6><u>WAIVER AND SEVERABILITY OF TERMS</u></h6>
                <p>
                  At any time, should SangaRaahi fail to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the TOS, such failure shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of this TOS is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties' intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of the TOS remain in full force and effect.
                </p>

                <h6><u>STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS</u></h6>
                <p>
                  You acknowledge, understand and agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or action arising out of or related to the use of our Services or the TOS must be filed within 1 year(s) after said claim or cause of action arose or shall be forever barred.
